# Progress

The project is currently under heavy development. The goal is to try a new way (at least new to me)
of creating sublime user interfaces by using borderless windows:


### Borderless window including a metro-style button
![Borderless](./img/borderless.png)

### Close button highlighted:

### Minimize button highlighted:

### Metro-style button highlighted:

### Metro-style button pressed:

The app should also be DPI-aware and use fluid design.
